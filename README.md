# 💰 Money Planner

**An envelope-budgeting app that helps you _plan_ your money — not just track it.**

Plan your income across categories at the start of each period, then watch
*planned vs. spent vs. remaining* update as you log real spending.

## ✨ The idea

Most finance apps are *trackers* — they tell you where your money went after it's
gone. Money Planner is a **planner**. It's built around **envelope budgeting**:

1. **Enter your income** for a period (e.g. July 2026).
2. **Split** that income across categories — Rent, Food, Savings, Fun… Each
   category is a virtual *envelope* you fill up front.
3. As the period goes on, **log spending** against each envelope.
4. See, per category and overall: **planned vs. spent vs. remaining** — with charts.

Delete a category mid-period? Its unspent allocation flows back into an
**Unallocated** pool, ready to re-split — while its past expenses stay on record
so your history is never distorted.

## 🎯 Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🧧 **Envelope budgeting** | Allocate income to categories; spend against the plan |
| 📊 **Visual insight** | Pie chart of your split, progress bars for spent-vs-planned, spending-over-time line charts |
| 🔁 **Recurring rules** | Templates for regular income/expenses (rent, salary) that pre-fill new periods |
| 🧮 **Unallocated tracking** | Always know how much income is still free to assign |
| 📌 **Persistent balance bar** | Remaining balance stays visible on every screen |
| 🕓 **History** | Read-only summaries and charts for past periods |
| 🔐 **Local security** | PIN + biometric unlock (`local_auth`) |
| ☁️ **Encrypted sync** | Push an **AES-encrypted** blob to a private GitHub repo — the cloud only ever sees ciphertext |

## 🏗️ Architecture

A clean, layered structure that keeps domain, data, and UI separate:

```
lib/
├── main.dart                 # Entry point — boots the SQLite database
├── app.dart                  # MaterialApp: theming + routing
├── models/                   # Domain entities (pure Dart, no Flutter deps)
│   ├── period.dart
│   ├── category.dart
│   ├── split.dart            # the "plan": income → category allocation
│   ├── expense.dart
│   └── recurring_rule.dart
├── data/
│   └── database_helper.dart  # SQLite schema + connection (sqflite / ffi)
├── theme/
│   └── app_theme.dart        # Light & dark Material 3 themes
├── widgets/
│   └── remaining_balance_bar.dart   # shared sticky balance bar
└── screens/
    └── dashboard/            # current-period overview
```

### Data model

Five tables in SQLite, wired with foreign keys:

- **`periods`** — one row per planning period, holds total income
- **`categories`** — reusable envelopes (Rent, Food, …), with color + icon
- **`splits`** — the plan: how much of a period's income each category gets
- **`expenses`** — actual spending logged against a split
- **`recurring_rules`** — templates for repeating income/expenses

Expenses deliberately outlive their split so historical periods stay accurate
even after a category is removed.

## 🔒 Security model

- **Unlock** — biometric via `local_auth`, with a PIN fallback stored as a
  **salted hash** (never plaintext).
- **Sync** — data is exported to JSON, **encrypted with AES** (key derived from
  the PIN via PBKDF2), and only then pushed to GitHub as `data.enc`. The remote
  never sees anything but ciphertext.
- **Tokens** — the GitHub token lives in `flutter_secure_storage`, never in
  source. Local database files and secrets are `.gitignore`d.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

| Concern | Package |
|---|---|
| Local database | `sqflite` (+ `sqflite_common_ffi` for desktop) |
| Charts | `fl_chart` |
| State management | `provider` |
| HTTP / GitHub API | `http` |
| Encryption | `encrypt`, `crypto` |
| Secure token storage | `flutter_secure_storage` |
| Biometric / PIN | `local_auth` |
| Date & currency formatting | `intl` |

## 🚀 Getting started

**Prerequisites:** [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) 3.44+
(bundles Dart 3.12).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheLis3k/MoneyPlaner.git
cd MoneyPlaner
flutter pub get
flutter run          # pick a device, or -d windows / -d chrome
```

Run the checks:

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

> **Windows note:** running the app on the Windows desktop target requires
> [Developer Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development)
> enabled (for plugin symlink support). Android/iOS builds need Android
> Studio / Xcode set up respectively.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 0** — Project scaffold, data model, SQLite schema
- [x] **Phase 1** — New Period & Add Expense screens, numeric dashboard, category detail with expense history
- [x] **Phase 2** — Charts (pie split, planned-vs-spent bars, spending-over-time line)
- [x] **Phase 3** — Recurring rules: templates, pre-fill new periods, auto-generate expenses
- [ ] **Phase 4** — PIN + biometric lock screen
- [ ] **Phase 5** — Encrypted GitHub sync (push/pull `data.enc`)
- [ ] **Phase 6** — History view, edge-case polish

**Extras already in:** custom categories with icon/color picker · full Polish localization (`pl`) with zł currency · period switcher.
